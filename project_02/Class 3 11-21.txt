Commit hash

commit identified by hash that is shown in git log

git remote -v

git remote add <name> <url>

git remote rm <name> - deletes the remote reference (not the remote itself)

git pull actually carries out two separate operations: fetch and merge

Remote repos
git fetch
local repos
git merge
working copy

git reset <commit-hash> sets the current status of your working branch to be the given commit, with all changes past the commit marked as unstaged.  This can "back up" multiple commits. --hard deletes all unstaged changes

git stash
git stash -pop
