Name: Saint Louis Savvy Coders Meetup
Date: November 29, 2017
Time: 6:30 pm to 8:00 pm (ran over to nearly 9)
Topic: Website Design for SEO and Social Media Marketing

Description: The importance of Search Engine Optimization strategy, while designing a website. 
             How smart user paths affect web design. 
			 Making a site attractive to Google's bots as well as human users.

Questions: How will changes to NET neutrality effect SEO?  Short answer, not likely well for smaller companies.
           Was struck about the similarity of using the bounce rate (how long users stay on a page) to using the number of genuine links in the original page ranking to put the pages people are genuinely interested in at the top.

Next Steps: Build in an SEO plan from the beginning.  Site speed and crawlability are important, but so is site navigation and content.  URLs should be user friendly.  Mobile friendliness a must.  Announce your existence thru Google Search Console.

As interesting as the meetup was to me, I'm not sure whether website design is in my future.  If so, I would do as Liz Oeltjen at Seafoam Media indicated: watch the Google watchers for major developments.
